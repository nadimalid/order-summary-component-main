## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Breakpoints could be set differently for each project as required, and different CSS frameworks use different breakpoints

```css
### Common Media Query breakpoints:
| Breakpoint | Description |
| -------- | ---------- |
| < 481px | Mobile devices |
| 481px — 768px | iPads, Tablets |
| 769px — 1024px | Small screens, laptops |
| 1025px — 1200px | Desktops, large screens |
| 1201px and greater | Extra large screens, TV |
```

### Continued development

- Improve resposive design for different breakpoints

### Useful resources

- [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69IbzTWg5PM&t=484s&ab_channel=DaveGray) - This helped me understand resposive design and breakpoints better, it will help gain basic knowledge of resposive design and different breakpoints used by other CSS frameworks.
